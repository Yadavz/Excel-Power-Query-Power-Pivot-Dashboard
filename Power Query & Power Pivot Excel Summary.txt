This Excel Sales Analysis project uses Power Query and Power Pivot to analyze a sales dataset containing a sales sheet with 6299 data and a dimension sheet. The analysis included calculating total sales amount by country, analyzing sales by category and sales person, and analyzing sales amount by year and quarter for each sales person. The dashboard included features such as sales amount by country on a map, sales by category and sales person in a pivot table, and sales amount by year and quarter for each sales person in a pivot table. The auto-update feature was enabled to update the dashboard automatically when a new Excel file is added to the folder. The project demonstrates how Excel can be used to perform advanced data analysis and create user-friendly dashboards.
